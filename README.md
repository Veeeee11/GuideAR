# GuideAR

## Overview
GuideAR is a vision-based smart appliance guidance system designed to assist users in operating home appliances through real-time visual analysis and audio-based instructions. The system uses a camera to capture appliance interfaces, applies Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to identify labels and controls, and provides step-by-step voice guidance to help users perform appliance operations correctly.

This project focuses on improving accessibility, usability, and user experience in interacting with modern household appliances.

## Problem Statement
Many household appliances have complex control panels and poorly accessible instruction manuals. This creates difficulty for first-time users, elderly individuals, and users with limited technical familiarity. Traditional manuals do not provide real-time assistance during appliance operation.

GuideAR addresses this issue by offering an intelligent, interactive system that guides users in real time using visual input and audio feedback.

## Proposed Solution
GuideAR captures live video input from a camera and processes it using computer vision and OCR techniques to recognize appliance controls and instructions. Based on the detected information, the system provides sequential audio guidance to assist users in completing appliance tasks accurately and efficiently.
